Data Visualization for Product Design: Analyzing Faculty Publications
### Project Title  
**Data Visualization for Product Design: Analyzing Faculty Publications**

---

### README.md  

#### **Overview**  
This project provides an interactive and static data visualization system for analyzing publications by the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department faculty. It aims to identify trends and patterns in research contributions over the years across journals, conferences, book chapters, and research projects.

#### **Goals**  
1. **Visualization Objectives**:  
   - Show publication trends over time.  
   - Analyze contributions by individual faculty.  
   - Compare contributions across research categories.  

2. **Deliverables**:  
   - Interactive visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, Sankey diagrams).  
   - Static visualizations for presentations and documentation.  

3. **Target Audience**:  
   - Faculty, researchers, and students.

#### **Features**  
- **Data Sources**: Faculty publications data collected from the official NITJ website.  
- **Preprocessing**: Missing and inconsistent data are corrected for reliable visualization.  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Bar and stacked bar charts for category-wise analysis.  
  - Pie charts to show proportional contributions.  
  - Word clouds to highlight frequently used keywords or authors.  
  - Line charts to track yearly trends.  
  - Sankey diagrams for flow relationships.

#### **Setup Instructions**  
1. **Dependencies**:  
   Install the following Python libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib wordcloud numpy
   ```

2. **Input Files**:  
   Ensure the input data files (e.g., `.csv` files) are placed in the specified directory structure. Update file paths in the code if necessary.

3. **Run the Code**:  
   Execute individual scripts for specific visualizations or the complete analysis pipeline. Examples are provided in `dvpd_project_codes.docx`.

---

#### **Usage**  
- Use Jupyter Notebook or a Python IDE to execute the scripts.  
- Modify the `file_paths` variable to analyze different datasets.  
- Save visualizations as PNG files for reporting purposes.

---

#### **Challenges and Limitations**  
- Limited data availability from external sources.  
- Bias in data collection may affect analysis accuracy.  
- Variations in interpretation of visualizations.
